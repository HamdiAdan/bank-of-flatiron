# Bank of flatIron

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Guidelines

## Core Deliverables

The project should conform to the following set of core guidelines:

### As a user, I can:

- See a table of all transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table. Note that the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

## Bonus Deliverables

These bonus deliverables are optional challenges that won't affect your score but can enhance your project. Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

### As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
- Delete a transaction, which will remove it from the table.
